# Quantitative analysis of PET images
The presented workflow implements a methodology to quantitatively assess the metabolic glucose rate in large vessel structures by extracting well-defined Volume-of-Interest (VOI) and by applying a kinetic model on these extracted areas. 
This methodology aims to investigate and quantify the evolution of the glucose metabolism inside different anatomical areas (e.g., myocardium, large vascular structures). It consists of: 
1. data and image acquisition (e.g., PET and CT cardiovascular image),
2. volume-of-interest extraction,
3. image processing,
4. statistical and measurement analysis.
