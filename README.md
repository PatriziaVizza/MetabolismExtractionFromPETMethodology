The presented workflow implements a methodology to quantitatively assess the metabolic glucose rate in the large vessel structures by extracting well-defined Volume-of-Interest
(VOI) adn by applying a kinetic model on these extracted districts. 
This methodology aims to investigate and quantify the evolution of the glucose metabolism inside different anatomical districts (e.g., the myocardium and the large vascular 
structures). 
It consists of: (i) data and image acquisition (e.g., PET and CT cardiovascular image), (ii) volume-of-interest extraction, (iii) image processing, and (iv) statistical 
and measurement analysis.
